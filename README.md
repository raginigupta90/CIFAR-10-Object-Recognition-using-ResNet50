**CIFAR-10 Object Recognition using ResNet50**
# Overview

This project implements an image classification system using the CIFAR-10 dataset and a ResNet50 deep learning model. The goal is to accurately classify images into 10 categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

# Features

Uses ResNet50 (Residual Network) for high-accuracy image recognition.

Preprocessing of CIFAR-10 dataset with normalization and augmentation.

Transfer learning with pre-trained weights for faster convergence.

Model evaluation using accuracy and loss metrics.

Visualizes training performance and predictions.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib

Dataset: CIFAR-10 (60,000 images in 10 classes)

# How It Works

Load CIFAR-10 dataset.

Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment).

Build and fine-tune the ResNet50 model.

Train the model on CIFAR-10 data.

Evaluate model performance on the test set.

Predict and visualize sample outputs.

Usage
